# DataIO

This project is a Tamagotchi styled game with a modern twist. Users have to limit the amount of time spent on social media and their followers, read more books, work, and be active to keep their pet alive.

cheerlights.py is not my own code - find it at https://github.com/ElectronicsGeek/cheerlights/blob/master/cheerlights/cheerlights.py

ran in python 2.7

It uses the following libraries:

  - requests
  - github
  - cheerlights
  - time
  - Naked.toolshed.shell to execute node.js file
  - InstagramAPI (unofficial)
  - twython
  - tkinter
  - adafruit-io
  
The tamagotchi pet is displayed on an Adafruit 64x64 RGB Matrix Display run off the display bonnet and a pi zero w.

Most of the data is collected on a pi 4 (1GB).

The twython streamer is ran off a pi 3A+.
